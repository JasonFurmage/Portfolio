                        The Scion Coalition Scheme is an intensive, specially tailored training 
                        program run by Netmatters in order to give willing candidates the opportunity 
                        to enter the industry as web developers. Under the supervision of senior web 
                        developers, scions generally aim to complete training within six to nine months. 
                        The course is intensive and therefore the level of learning achieved is extensive 
                        in a short space of time.
