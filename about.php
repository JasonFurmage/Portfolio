                                I've been building computers and playing around with code as a hobby
                                since I was about 14 years old, but originally I pursed a career in animal care.
                                I went to University to study animal management and did work experience at
                                several zoos but eventually became interested in iOS app development.

                                paths to web and software development. Since then I've released 
                                two apps onto the iOS App Store and have recently completed the
